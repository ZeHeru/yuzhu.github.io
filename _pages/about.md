I am a second-year graduate student in the Department of Chemistry at Fudan University. My research interests are AI for SCI (Machine Learning Force Field) and CV (Deblurring for Scanning Tunneling Microscope, Open-Set Recognition).

I am currently conducting research at the Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemistry for Energy Materials in the Department of Chemistry under Professor Xu Xin, where I receive guidance from Professor Duan Sai. My primary focus is on “Reconstructing Pristine Molecular Orbitals from Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Images via Artificial Intelligence Approaches.” In addition, I am interning at Microsoft Research Asia (July 2024–present), where I have collaborated with colleagues to develop a universal machine learning force field and applied it to address the scientific question: Is diamond the limit of thermal transport properties? Furthermore, I have worked with computer vision colleagues at Microsoft Research Asia on open-set recognition.

You can find my CV here: [XX's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
